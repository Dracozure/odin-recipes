        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add water, anchovies, and dried kelp to shallow pot/pan.</li>
            <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without lid.</li>
            <li>Combine Gochujang, Gochugaru, and sugar into a mixture in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove anchovies and kelp after 15 minutes. Add rice cake, mixture,
                scallions, and <em>optional</em> fish cakes and hard boiled eggs.<br>
                <strong>Note: Stock should be around 2 and 1/2 cups.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Stir gently when it starts to boil, then let simmer and keep stirring until
                rice cake turns soft and sauce thickens and looks shiny. (Should take around
                10-15 minutes)<br>
                <strong>Note: If rice cakes not soft enough, add more water and continue
                    stirring until it softens.
                </strong><br>
                <strong>Note 2: If using frozen rice cakes, thaw and soak in cold water to
                    soften before cooking.
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve hot. If leftover remains, store in fridge
                and reheat whenever necessary. Finish everything in 3-4 days.
